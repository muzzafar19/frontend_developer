    <!-- The destructuring syntax is a JavaScript syntax that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, 
     or properties from objects, into distinct variables. It can be used in locations that receive data 
     (such as the left-hand side of an assignment or anywhere that creates new identifier bindings). -->



    <script>

        let arr = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "pink"];
        console.log(arr);

        // this is normal way to check arr and its index value



        let [red, green, blue, yellow, pink] = arr;
        console.log(arr);
        console.log(red);
        console.log(green);
        console.log(blue);


        // in this way we can choose which value we want to get from array
